[INSTALLATION]

After starting the "AWC.exe" for the first time an input window will open
that will ask you for the path in which the wallpapers (folder)
are located, that it is supposed to be cycled through.

Then you will have to input a time - either a predefined one from the drop
down, or a custom time chosen by yourself, by ticking the checkbox and
choosing it - and then after confirming if all has been input correctly
press the install button.

-> The "AWC.exe" will then create a shortcut in your autostart folder as
well as on your desktop and a system tray element will open on the 
bottom right hand side.

[FUNCTIONALITY]

All further configuration, as well as manual switching of the desktop can 
be done via the tray element with a right click on it. The program can 
also be exitted this way.

[CAUTION] Do not move tray element on top of Taskbar! [CAUTION]

System Tray elements:

"Open" - Will open a configuration window similar to the one of the 
	 install.

"Action - SwitchDesktop" - Switches the background wallpaper

"Exit" - Kills the task and closes the tray element

The program will start by itself when the computer is started.

After the installation process the "AWC.exe" will not start the 
configuration anymore but instead start the program.

[KNOWN-BUGS]

On small custom timescales the tray element can be very slow and
unresponsive. Also the manual desktop switch might not work.

Do not start the .exe twice. There is no feature preventing that
yet...
