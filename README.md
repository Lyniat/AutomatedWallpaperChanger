### Installation

The program for the windows version can either be run as a ".py" or a ".exe".
If it is run as an ".exe" then only the compiled installer has to be run.

>The code has been compiled via _pyinstaller_

The code can also be run in python3, however, one needs to fulfill the following dependencies:

* PySimpleGui
* PySimpleGuiQt
* winshell and pywin32 (includes win32con)

Additionally all references to the "AWC.exe" have to be changed to "../AWC.py" as well some other
direct references to ".exe" related files.

## Linux version
Disclaimer the code for this version has not been completed yet.
